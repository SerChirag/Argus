## Abstract

Vision is out most dominant sense and account for a majority of our sensory information.
But a lot of people suffer from undiagnosed optical disorders, especially myopia (Nearsightedness). It is expected that by 2050, 50% of the world's population, a total of nearly 5 billion, will suffer from myopia.

Thus, eye healthcare is of utmost importance in developing countries like India. We have sought to develop a web-application to facilitate the process of eye-checkup. 
**This app targets those people who have connection to the internet but cannot visit eye clinics due to affordability, remoteness etc.**

This project was made for TopCoder Hackathon organized in April 2019.
